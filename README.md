# Colony Event List Solution

This is a small react event viewing app made as challenge for [colony](https://github.com/JoinColony/coding-challenge-events-list). This is not production ready code.

## Develop

1. Clone the repo and install all the dependencies by running `pnpm install`. You can use other package managers but you won't be able to take advantage of the lockfile.

2. Install `vercel` cli by running `pnpm install -g vercel`.
3. Create an API key on [ethplorer](https://ethplorer.io/). 
4. Set the API key as an environment variable called `ETHPLORER_API_KEY`
5. Run `vercel dev` command to run the whole application.
